Students in the course will work together, using collaborative software tools, to create an interactive map of the worldâ€™s environmental issues, arranged by country.  Each student will be assigned to a particular country, based on their response to the Intro Questionnaire.  Each student is tasked with writing an essay about the top three environmental issues in that country, and the role of IT in one or more of those issues in that country.  The paper must be 1200-1500 words long, and contain two parts of approximately equal length: first, a description of the top three environmental issues in that country, in order of importance, along with a brief summary of how you determined their order of importance; and second, a detailed description of some aspect of the relationship between a particular information technology and one of these three issues. The goal of the first half of the paper is to develop a broad understanding of the environmental concerns of a given country.  The goal of the second half is to develop a more in-depth understanding of a particular facet of one of those concerns.  The paper should include at least five reputable references (e.g., scholarly articles, government reports, or similar documents, but not Wikipedia, Yahoo Answers, etc.) to support its arguments.
